Follow these steps:
● Note: For this task, you will need to create an HTML file to get input from
a user. If you need a refresher on how to do this, go back to the
example.js and index.html files in your Task 1 folder for examples.
● Create a JavaScript file called palindrome.js.
● Write a program that asks the user to enter a word.
● Using a while loop, the program must determine whether or not the
word is a palindrome, i.e. whether it reads the same forwards and
backwards. An example of a palindrome is the word “racecar”.
● Output the given word and whether or not it is a palindrome, e.g.
“racecar is a palindrome”
